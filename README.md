# Employee Unplanned Leave Analysis

**A Data Analyst case study that transforms raw attendance logs into an actionable calendar view and an executive dashboard to monitor unplanned leaves and NCNS.**

---

## Project Summary
This project analyzes employee attendance data to surface unplanned leaves (UNPL), No Call No Show (NCNS), and other absence patterns. The dataset is transformed into a calendar view to visualize daily attendance by employee and aggregated into pivot tables for trend analysis. A final Excel dashboard summarizes key metrics for TLs/AMs and HR stakeholders.

**Goal:** Provide insights and a monitoring dashboard to reduce unplanned absences and support staffing decisions.
